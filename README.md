## Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive set of Excel dashboards developed for B&J Biscuit Company. The primary dashboard **(Dashboard 1)** offers a holistic view of the business, providing key insights into revenue distribution, profitability, customer demographics, geographic performance, and overall sales metrics. 

**Dashboard 2**, on the other hand, focuses on providing a deeper, time-based analysis of revenue trends. This dashboard delves into monthly, quarterly, and weekly revenue performance, offering insights into month-over-month changes to help identify seasonal patterns, sales spikes, and business cycles. 

_This project uses data I obtained through the YouTube channel DataWithDecision365 to carry out a detailed business analysis for B&J Biscuit._
