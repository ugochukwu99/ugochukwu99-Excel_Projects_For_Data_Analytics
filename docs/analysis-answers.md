## 📊 Dashboard Build

### 1. 💰 Revenue Distribution

**📈 Chart: Revenue by Product Price Category**

Insights:

High-priced products account for approximately 90% of total revenue ($55.21M), driven by strong demand and premium pricing (e.g., Shortbread at $45, Vanilla Wafers at $36). This highlights the company’s reliance on a smaller range of high-value items for the bulk of its income.

In contrast, lower-cost items contribute around 10% ($6.35M), with prices between $5 and $9. While their individual margins are lower, their high sales volume indicates strong appeal among price-sensitive customers, supporting broader market reach and customer acquisition.
Business Implications:
The company’s revenue is heavily dependent on premium products, highlighting their profitability. However, lower-priced items play a key role in customer acquisition and broadening market reach.

Strategic Opportunity: While premium products remain the revenue core, promoting high-margin, lower-priced items (e.g., Lemon Crisps with ~22% margin) could enhance profitability without compromising volume.

Young Shoppers (15–29):
Contributing 19.44%, this group shows potential for long-term growth and brand loyalty despite lower current spend.

![](../screenshots/Revenue_by_Payment_Method_1.png)

The revenue distribution across payment methods reveals a tightly contested landscape, with no single method dominating. Debit Cards lead slightly, accounting for 25.4% of total revenue, or approximately $15.62 million, suggesting a mild preference for direct bank transactions. Close behind are Mobile Payments at 25.11% ($15.46 million), reflecting growing adoption of digital wallets and tech-savvy customer behavior. Credit Cards and Cash follow closely at 24.77% and 24.75%, respectively, with Cash bringing in the lowest total revenue of around $15.24 million. The narrow range between the highest and lowest contributors—just about $382,000 or 0.62%—highlights the diverse and balanced payment preferences among customers, though the slightly lower share of Cash may point to a gradual shift away from physical currency.
